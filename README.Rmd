To reduce computational complexity, [dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html)
only uses non-singletons as seeds for denoising.
For this strategy to work, each true sequence must be represented by at least two identical reads.
Especially with long amplicons, the probability of two reads having exactly the same errors is much lower than the probability of being error-free, so in practice this means that each true sequence must have two error-free reads.
This becomes problematic for rare sequences in long amplicon libraries.

Tzara (named after [Tristan Tzara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Tzara), a central figure in the Dada art movement, who described the ["cut-up" technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) for poetry) implements an alternative method for dealing with long reads:
  - Cut reads of the targeted region into smaller domains using hidden Markov models (via [Hmmer](https://hmmer.org)) or covariance models (via [Infernal](http://eddylab.org/infernal/))
  - Use dada2 to separately denoise each sub-region/domain
  - Concatenate denoised sequences for the different domains which originated in the same read to get denoised sequences for the full read

There are also methods for deeper chimera checking and attempting to preserve information from reads which dada2 was unable to successfully map to a read.

## Installation

`tzara` is yet available from CRAN or Bioconductor,
but you can install the latest github version using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("brendanf/tzara")
```

## Example

Coming soon!
